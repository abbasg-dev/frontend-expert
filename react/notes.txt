Introduction
React is one of the most popular frontend libraries to create performant and maintainable user interfaces.

React Basics

React
A JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. React uses a component-based architecture to create interfaces with an intuitive declarative approach.

Component
A reusable independent piece of a user interface. In modern React, components are usually functional components, which are simply functions that return JSX.

JSX
Short for JavaScript XML, a JavaScript syntax extension for inlining XML and HTML in JavaScript.

ReactDOM
A package used with React to work as the bridge between React elements and the actual DOM in the browser. The most frequently used ReactDOM function is the render function, which adds a component to the DOM.

React.Fragment
A React container component that renders its children without adding any additional DOM nodes. This can be used for returning multiple adjacent elements without wrapping them in an unnecessary element.

Fragments can also be created by using an empty tag, rather than the Fragment export from React.

Conditional Rendering
The process of changing the returned element of a component based on some condition. Conditional rendering can be achieved in a variety of ways, but the most common utilizes ternary operators or short circuit evaluation. This works because null, undefined, true and false all do not render anything.

Props
A JavaScript object passed as a parameter to functional components, containing all of the key-value pairs that were passed as attributes to the component.

Event-Driven Programming

SyntheticEvent
The object type passed to React event handler functions. Synthetic events generally work the same as native events, but with more consistency across browsers.
