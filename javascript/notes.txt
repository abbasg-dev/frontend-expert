1. Introduction
JavaScript is the third and arguably most important pillar of the holy trinity of the modern web. Master it, and you'll be capable of breathing life into any webpage.

2. JavaScript Basics
As always, we begin by reviewing the nuts and bolts of the subject matter. Let's get started!

JavaScript
The primary programming language of the web, primarily used for adding functionality to websites. JavaScript is a general purpose multi-paradigm programming language with dynamic typing.

Paradigm
A style of programming. Oftentimes languages are built with a specific paradigm in mind, but JavaScript is known as a multi-paradigm language, because it allows for programming in a variety of paradigms. Some of the major paradigms of JavaScript include:

Event-driven: Functions can be made to respond to events, such as when a user clicks on an element or scrolls down the page.
Functional: Functions can be written as "pure functions", meaning functions that always have the same output for a given set of arguments and never produce side effects. Additionally, JavaScript supports first-class functions and higher-order functions. This means that functions can be treated as normal values, passed as arguments to other functions and returned from functions.
Object-oriented: Objects can be created as custom data stores and they can be made to inherit from each other.
Imperative: Programs can be written by explicitly describing the control flow, such as with loops and conditionals.
Declarative: Programs can be written by describing the desired output with implicit control flow. Oftentimes this is associated with functional programming (e.g. using the forEach function to loop over an array instead of a for loop).

Primitive
The most basic data types of a language. In JavaScript, there are 7 primitive types:

Number: Numeric values, including integers and decimal values.
BigInt: Integers too large to store in a number.
Boolean: A binary value of true or false.
String: A sequence of characters.
Symbol: A dynamically generated unique value.
Null: A nonexistent value.
Undefined: A value that has not been set.

JavaScript has a typeof operator that can get the type of a value as a lowercase string. However, do be aware that this function does have some special casing.

3. Variables And Scoping
What do you call something that is both a paradox and a misnomer?

A constant variable.

let
A keyword for declaring a block-scoped variable that cannot be accessed before initialization.

var
A keyword for declaring a function-scoped variable that is automatically initialized to undefined when it is hoisted.

const
A keyword for declaring a constant value. Constants have the same behavior as variables declared with let, except they cannot be reassigned.

Block Scope
The behavior of a variable that is only accessible inside of the block it was defined. Most of the time, the block will simply be the nearest pair of curly braces to the declaration.

Function Scope
The behavior of a variable that is accessible anywhere inside of the function it was defined.

Hoisting
The process by which the JavaScript engine moves variable declarations to the top of their scope, allocating memory for them before reaching the line of code where they are declared. For variables declared with var, they are initialized to undefined until reaching the line of code that initializes the variable. For variables declared with let or const, the variable is not initialized and thus cannot be accessed before the line of code that initializes it.

4. Arrays
The quintessential data structure that can be used in a wide array of different situations.

Array
A data structure for storing lists of information.

JavaScript arrays are mutable and can contain data of different types. While these are just standard objects, they have a special syntax for easily creating and updating them.

5. Objects
Why is JavaScript a mean programming language?

Because it objectifies almost everything.

Object
The base non-primitive data structure of JavaScript used to store key-value pairs. Object keys are usually strings, but they can also be symbols. Values on the other hand can be any type.

Objects are usually declared with the object literal syntax.

Symbol
A primitive value in JavaScript used for unique values.

A symbol is created using the Symbol(description) function, which returns a unique symbol. Even if two symbols have the same description, they will still be considered unique.

While symbols created using the Symbol(description) function are completely unique, symbols can also be created using Symbol.for(key). This works the same way, except two calls to this function with the same key will return the same symbol, based on a global symbol registry.

6. Equality And Type Coercion
== == ===

However...

== !== ===

Loose Equality
The most basic equality operator in JavaScript using ==. Loose equality compares values regardless of types following these steps:

If both values are either null or undefined, return true.
Convert all booleans to numbers. True converts to 1 and false converts to 0.
If comparing a number to a string, convert the string to a number.
If comparing an object to a string, convert the object using its toString() or valueOf() methods.
If the types are the same, follow the same rules as strict equality.

In general, strict equality should be preferred due to it being easier to predict. However, loose equality can be useful for checking against null and undefined at once with value == null.

Strict Equality
A JavaScript equality operator using ===. Strict equality compares both values and types following these steps:

If either value is NaN, return false.
If the values have different types, return false.
If both values are null or both values are undefined, return true.
If both values are objects, return true if they are the same object. False otherwise.
If both values are of the same primitive type, return true if the values are the same. False otherwise.

7. Syntactic Sugar And Modern JavaScript
Not as sweet as table sugar, but delightful nonetheless.

Arrow Function
A more concise function syntax, particularly useful for replacing short anonymous functions. 

However, if an arrow function only requires one line, then the curly braces and return keyword can be removed. Additionally, when these are used inline such as for a call to the array map function, the semicolon must be removed. Finally, if there is only one parameter, the parentheses around the parameter can also be removed. 

There are a few constraints to arrow functions which will be explored throughout the crash course. The most important of these is that arrow functions do not have their own this binding. Additionally, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors or generators.

Destructuring Assignment
A JavaScript syntax for saving values from an array or object in variables.

When destructuring an object, fields can also be renamed.

Destructuring can also be used in a function parameter.

Rest Operator
A JavaScript operator using ... for condensing multiple elements into a single array. This uses the same syntax as the spread operator, but functionally is essentially the opposite.

Rest syntax can be used in both arrays and objects to get all of the values not being destructured. 

Moreover, rest syntax can be used for function parameters to accept an infinite number of arguments, which are accessible as an array.

Spread Operator
A JavaScript operator using ... for expanding iterables into individual elements.

The spread syntax can also be used to combine two arrays. Similarly, objects can be spread as well. Moreover, {...obj} can be used as a shallow clone of an object, since it creates a new object with the same fields.

Template Literal
Strings created using backticks `` that allow for inlining expressions rather than needing concatenation. Inlined expressions use the syntax ${expression}.

Template literals also allow for tagging to write a function that defines custom behavior for the template literals. Tagging can be read about further in the MDN documentation, but it doesn't tend to be used too often.

Null Coalescing
Also referred to as nullish coalescing, an operator using ?? for providing a default value if a value is null. If the value on the left side of the operator is not null or undefined, that value is used. Otherwise, the value on the right side of the operator is used.

Optional Chaining
A JavaScript operator using ?. for reading object properties without throwing an error if the object is null. However if any values in the chain are null or undefined, it will return undefined rather than throwing an error.

Short Circuit Evaluation
A method of utilizing the evaluation order of JavaScript to conditionally run code. This usually uses the && operator, because for it to return true, both the left and right expressions must be true. Since the browser runs code from left to right, if it encounters false on the left side, it does not even run the code on the right side. Thus, this can be used to conditionally run code.

Less commonly, short circuit evaluation can also be used with the || operator. Since this operator only needs one expression to be true, if the left side is true then the right side will not be evaluated. This is essentially the opposite of the behavior with &&.

8. Connecting JavaScript To HTML

A little more nuanced than simply throwing a <script> tag into your HTML.

<script>
The HTML tag for adding JavaScript to the document. Usually the <script> appears in the <head> with no children. Instead of children, it usually has the src attribute set to the path of a JavaScript file.

By default, scripts block the browser from continuing to parse and render the rest of the DOM until the script has finished downloading and executing. However, there are two boolean attributes that can change this behavior:

defer: Fetch the script asynchronously without blocking the page. Only execute the script after the DOM has finished being parsed.
async: Fetch the script asynchronously without blocking the page. Whenever the script is ready, stop parsing the DOM and execute the script. This is usually only for scripts that do not need access to the DOM, because otherwise the behavior will be inconsistent based on how quickly the script downloaded.

Alternatively, scripts were traditionally placed at the bottom of the <body> to ensure the DOM finished loading before running the script. However, this is usually slower than using the defer attribute, since the script will not be downloaded until reaching the script tag at the end of the body.

9. Dom Manipulation

An acceptable form of manipulation.

Dom Manipulation
Using JavaScript to change the content, structure or styles of the page. There are a lot of functions and properties related to dom manipulation, but these are some of the more common ones:

Getting Elements:

document.getElementById(id): Gets a single element based on its id attribute.
document.querySelector(cssSelector): Gets a single element based on a CSS selector. If multiple elements match the selector, returns the first one.
document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector): Gets all elements matching a CSS selector as a NodeList.
document.getElementsByTagName(tagName): Gets all elements with a specific HTML tag as an HTMLCollection.
document.getElementsByClassName(className): Gets all elements with a specific class as an HTMLCollection.

Setting Attributes:

element.style.property: Sets a CSS property using inline styles, although CSS classes should usually be preferred. The style object will only contain inline styles, not those set with CSS.
element.setAttribute('attribute', 'value'): Sets an HTML attribute to a specific value.
element.textContent: The text content of an element, including that of any children. Note: this is slightly different from element.innerText, which only gets text that is actually rendered and element.innerHTML which gets the entire HTML code as a string.
element.attribute: An alternative to the setAttribute function, attributes can be directly edited via their property name.
element.classList: An object for updating CSS classes. Specifically, this contains 3 primary functions: add(className), remove(className) and toggle(className).

Adding And Removing Elements:

document.createElement(tagName): Creates a new HTML element.
document.createTextNode(text): Creates a text node as an alternative to setting textContent.
document.createDocumentFragment(): Creates a document fragment, which is useful for appending multiple elements at once after a loop.
element.appendChild(element): Appends an element to the end of the contents of another element.
element.append(node1, node2, ...): Appends 1 or more nodes (elements or text) to the end of the contents of another element.
element.prepend(node1, node2, ...): Prepends 1 or more nodes (elements or text) to the beginning of the contents of another element.
element.remove(): Removes the element from the DOM.

Sizes and Scrolling:

window.innerWidth: The width of the browser window.
window.innerHeight: The height of the browser window.
window.getComputedStyle(element): Gets styles as they are currently rendered on the page, converted to pixels.
element.clientHeight: The height of visible content and padding.
element.offsetHeight: The height of visible content, padding, borders and scrollbars.
element.scrollHeight: The height of all content and padding, including content scrolled out of view.
element.offsetTop: The distance from the outer top border of the element to the inner top border of the nearest positioned parent.
element.scrollIntoView(): Scrolls the container so the element is in view.
element.scrollTo(optionsObj): Scrolls the element to a specified top value in the options object. Additionally, behavior: 'smooth' will create a smooth transition.

Event-Driven Programming
The old adage "better to be proactive than reactive" doesn't apply here!

A programming paradigm where code runs as a response to events, usually initiated by the user.
To create an event listener, use element.addEventListener(eventName, callback, useCapture). If the third argument is true, the callback will fire during the capturing phase rather than the default bubbling phase.
Additionally, addEventListener can be called with an options object as the third parameter instead of the useCapture boolean. This object can contain the following possible values:

capture: The same as the boolean argument option; true for capturing, false for bubbling.
once: If true, automatically removes the event listener after the event fires once.
passive: If true, indicates to the browser that event.preventDefault() will not be called. This is useful for the browser to optimize performance, particularly with mobile scrolling events such as touchstart and touchmove to indicate to the browser that scrolling will not be cancelled.
signal: An AbortSignal, usually coming from an AbortController. If the signal's abort() method is called, the event listener will be removed.
To remove an event listener, call element.removeEventListener(eventName, callback, useCapture) or element.removeEventListener(eventName, callback, optionsObj) with the exact same parameters as were used to create the event listener.

Event Propagation
The process by which an event travels through the DOM to call event listeners on nested elements. Event propagation consists of 3 phases:
Capturing: The event travels down from the root of the document to the event target.
Target: The event fires on the event target.
Bubbling: The event travels up from the event target to the root of the document.
At any point in the propagation process, an event listener can call event.stopPropagation(), which will stop the propagation process.

Event Delegation
The process of using a single event listener on a parent element to manually delegate events to children, rather than using event listeners on each child.
Event delegation takes advantage of event propagation.
In the event a container has many children that all have similar event listeners, event delegation can make substantial performance improvements by lowering the total number of active event listeners. The event.target property can then be used to determine which child was the source of the event.

Promise

You'll understand how promises work in JavaScript. Then you'll be able to do really cool asynchronous stuff. And if you catch yourself confused, well you can finally abandon frontend development.

An object used for asynchronous operations. These objects have a state of either pending, fulfilled or rejected.

A Promise is created with the Promise() constructor, which takes in a callback function, oftentimes called the executor. This callback function has two callback functions as parameters:

resolve(value): Fulfills the Promise and sets its value.
reject(error): Rejects the Promise and sets an error message.
The Promise object has three primary functions:

then(fulfilledFn rejectedFn): Calls fulfilledFn if the Promise is fulfilled and rejectedFn if it is rejected. Returns a new fulfilled Promise with the return value of the callback function.
catch(rejectedFn): Calls rejectedFn if the Promise is rejected. returns a new fulfilled Promise with the return value of the callback function.
finally(callback): Calls the callback function whenever the Promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected).
Since these functions all return a new Promise, they can be chained together, such as promise.then(doX).then(doY).catch(handleError).finally(doZ).

async function
A function declared using the async keyword, causing the function to implicitly return a Promise and allowing for usage of the await keyword.

Asynchronous functions are primarily an alternative syntax to chaining calls to Promise.then.

await
A keyword indicating that JavaScript should wait for a Promise to settle before continuing execution of the code. Traditionally this is only available in async functions, but it can also be used at the top level of modules.

Working With The Server

fetch
A JavaScript function for making network requests.

fetch(url) returns a pending Promise. Once the network request completes, the promise will either resolve or reject. Any response other than a network error will result in a resolved Promise. The url parameter can be either a string or a URL object.

This function can also take an options object as a second parameter. These are some of the more common options to use:

method: The request method as a string, such as 'GET' or 'POST'.
body: The body of the request, oftentimes used to pass FormData.
headers: Headers to be added to the network request, oftentimes by creating a Headers object, although a standard object can be used as well.
signal: An AbortSignal, usually coming from an AbortController. If the signal's abort() method is called, the request will be aborted.
When the request comes back from the server, the Promise returned by fetch will resolve to a Response object. This object has a variety of properties and methods for interacting with the network response. These are some of the most useful ones:

response.text(): Returns a Promise with a text representation of the response body.
response.json(): Returns a Promise with an object representation of the response body.
response.status: A number representation of the response status code. A successful request will be in the 200-299 range, most commonly 200.
response.ok: A boolean representation of the response status code. A successful request in the 200-299 range will be true, everything else evaluates to false.
response.headers: A Headers object containing the headers included with the response.

Timers And Intervals

setInterval
A JavaScript function for calling a function repeatedly over an interval.

setTimeout
A JavaScript function for delaying execution of a callback function.

requestAnimationFrame
A JavaScript function for calling a callback function before the next browser repaint. These are oftentimes used for animations to update the animation every frame.

Closure
A function along with a saved reference to the lexical environment it was defined in. Simply put, this means functions have access to all of the variables in scope at the time of definition, even if the parent function has returned.

Lexical Environment
An internal data structure used for keeping track of identifiers (variable and function names) and their values. A lexical environment stores all of the locally available identifiers as well as a reference to the parent environment.

Lexical Scoping
The scoping system in JavaScript that ensures all code blocks have access to all identifiers in their parent environment. When an identifier is not defined locally, JavaScript will look to the parent environment for it. If it is still not found there, it will look in grandparent's environment and so on before looking in the global environment.

this
A JavaScript keyword for referencing the context in which the current code is running.

The value of this is determined at runtime. In the browser, it will follow these general rules:

At the top level of a file (the global context), this refers to the global object, which is the window.
In a standard function without strict mode, this refers to the global object, which is the window.
In a standard function in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an object method, this refers to that object.
In a constructor function, this refers to the object being constructed.
When using event listeners, the object being listened to will be bound to this, assuming a standard function was used.
Arrow functions do not create their own this context, instead they retain the value of the enclosing context.

JavaScript provides three functions for binding the value of this to functions:

func.bind(thisArg): Returns a new function with thisArg bound to this.
func.call(thisArg, x, y): Calls func(x, y) with thisArg bound to this.
func.apply(thisArg, [x, y]): Calls func(x, y) with thisArg bound to this.

Classes

Prototypal Inheritance
The inheritance model used in JavaScript. The key difference between prototypal inheritance and classical inheritance is that in prototypal inheritance objects only inherit from other objects, rather than using class blueprints.

Prototype Chain
The chain of inheritance created through object prototypes. When a property does not exist on an object, JavaScript will look to its prototype. If it doesn't exist on that object, it will look to its prototype and so on until the chain ends with a null prototype.
Internally, the prototype is stored on the [[Prototype]] property, but we cannot directly access this property. Instead, we have a few alternative ways to get and set prototypes:

obj.__proto__: Although being deprecated, this property was the original way to get and set the prototype of an object and is still useful for debugging.
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj): Returns the prototype object of obj.
Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto): Sets the prototype object of obj to proto.
Object.create(proto): Creates a new object with the prototype set to proto.

Function Constructor
A function intended to be used to construct an object using the new operator.
When the new operator is used, a new object is created automatically. The prototype of the new object is then set to the prototype property of the constructor function (remember functions are just objects). Finally, the constructor function is called with the new object bound to this.
By default the prototype property of the function will simply be an object with its constructor property set to the function itself. However, this can be changed.

Class
A JavaScript syntax to emulate that of classical inheritance, although for the most part it is syntactic sugar on top of function constructors (classes are actually just functions under the hood).
Classes can also extend other classes, which internally creates a prototype chain. In the class constructor, super can be used to call the parent constructor. super.method() can also be used in the class to call parent classes.

Currying
The process of transforming a function to treat its parameters as a sequence of individual function calls that each take one parameter.
Currying is achieved by creating functions that return other functions, taking advantage of closures.

Generator
An iterable object created by using a generator function.

A generator function is defined using function*. Then each yield results in another item being added to the iterable generator object.

The generator object has three methods:

next(value): Returns an object with the next value in the iterator and a done boolean. Optionally passes a value back into the generator function.
return(value): Adds a passed in argument to the iterable results and ends iteration.
throw(error): Throws an error, stopping code execution unless the error is caught.

Modules
JavaScript code that runs in isolation, without polluting the global namespace.

Traditionally modules were implemented using immediately invoked function expressions, but in modern JavaScript there is a type="module" attribute that can be added to script tags. This attribute will have a few key effects:

Identifiers at the top level will be scoped to the file rather than globally.
The file will be in strict mode by default.
The await keyword can be used at the top level.
The script will be deferred by default.
Modules can then access each other by using the import and export keywords.

Immediately Invoked Function Expression
Also called an IIFE, a function that is immediately called after its definition. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, most notably to create a function scope to isolate code with.

There are a few ways to define an IIFE, but the most common is using an anonymous or arrow function. This function is then wrapped in parentheses, which causes it to be treated as an expression. Finally, () is added to call the function.
