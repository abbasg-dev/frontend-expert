Client—Server Model

Client
A machine or process that requests data or service from a server. In the case of the web, browsers are clients that request HTML pages from servers.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

Server
A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

Client—Server Model
The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting data or service from servers and servers providing data or service to clients.

Webpage Request Lifecycle

Domain Name System
Oftentimes abbreviated as DNS, the process used for translating domain names to IP Addresses.

Transmission Control Protocol
Oftentimes abbreviated as TCP, a network protocol used to establish a connection between two computers on the internet. TCP is the primary mechanism by which HTTP requests are delivered.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Oftentimes abbreviated as HTTP, a common network protocol used for sending requests and responses on the web.

HTTP requests generally have three components: the request line, headers and a body (although the body is optional for some request methods). The request line includes the method, path and HTTP version. Headers contain key value pairs of extra information for the server. The body contains the contents of the request, such as new data being uploaded in a post request.

HTTP responses follow the same general format as requests, but in the top line (referred to as a status line), there is no method or path. Instead, this line contains a status code and message.

HTTPS
The HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of HTTP that's used for secure communication online. It requires servers to have trusted certificates and uses the Transport Layer Security (TLS), a security protocol built on top of TCP, to encrypt data communicated between a client and a server.
